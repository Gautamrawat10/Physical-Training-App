📌 Project Overview:
The Physical Training App is a Python-based desktop application developed to help users with customized exercise routines. It provides information about different workouts, suggests exercises based on user preferences or needs, and presents them in an organized, interactive way.

⚙️ Core Features:
Exercise Recommendations:
Uses a dataset (megaGymDataset2.csv) to suggest appropriate exercises.
Likely uses machine learning (similarity-based filtering, as seen in similarity.pkl) to match user preferences.
Exercise Display:
Shows exercise images (g1.jpg to g5.jpg) and relevant descriptions.

Modules Included:
Contact.py: Handles contact-related information or feedback.
Exercises.py: Contains logic for retrieving/displaying exercises.
Home.py and main.py: Serve as the main user interface (likely using Streamlit or Tkinter).
Main.ipynb: Contains development notes, testing, or prototype logic.

Saved Data:
exercises_list.pkl & similarity.pkl: Preprocessed machine learning models or data used for recommendations.

📁 Documentation Files:
Certificate of Originality.doc & Progress Report.docx: Part of the official submission (for academic/institutional use).

🧠 Technologies Used:
Python 3.x
Pandas & NumPy (data processing)
Pickle (model saving/loading)
Streamlit or Tkinter for the UI

🎯 Possible Use Case:
A user opens the app, inputs their preferences (e.g., type of workout, body part focus), and gets a list of suitable exercises with images and descriptions.
